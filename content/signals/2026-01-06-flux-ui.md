Finally, **FluxCD has a GUI** (via Flux Operator). People say it looks like ArgoCD. I’ve never used Argo, but if that’s true, it’s a massive move for the ecosystem.

The main reason for Flux’s lower adoption was the lack of out-of-the-box visibility. Many teams want to see the status of resources directly, rather than relying on custom notifications or parsing logs when an update hangs.

At my current workplace, I had to build a feedback system that reports state back into the GitLab pipeline. But this approach is inefficient. It doesn’t make sense for every company to build its own solution just because the tool lacks a default feedback mechanism.
